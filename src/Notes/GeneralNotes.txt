1) String Interpolations
- quotes for string Interpolations:
Remember to use the back tick  ` and NOT regular single or double quotes (' and ") for string interpolation 
on our image src. This is an easy mistake to make as you cannot interpolate the strings when using regular quotes, 
you must use back ticks!

2) State vs Props
In this project, our Parent Component is App.js, and only here, we have state (something that changes bc of user interaction).
This state is then passed down to the CardList Component (like an attribute) - just like how we have HTML attributes, we sent down monsters and give it our state
As soon as we pass our state down to a component, this component receives it as a prop.

State usually lives in just ONE LOCATION or a SPECIFIC STATE only on one location and it trickles down as props

3) Asynchronous vs Synchronous
- Synchronous action: 
something that we can expect to happen almost immediately. It's something that pretty much happens and JavaScript knows the amount of time it'll take so javascript
will wait for that thing to finish before it continues.

- Asynchronous action:
Running the rest of the code afterwards an asynchronous action or event is something that actually takes
an indefinite amount of time that JavaScript does not know.
So what it does is it actually runs the rest of the code after and then when the asynchronous event
finishes it then runs that finished event.

4) HTML Synthetic Events - html onchange vs jsx onchange (they're different, and we use jsx)
