1) String Interpolations
- quotes for string Interpolations:
Remember to use the back tick  ` and NOT regular single or double quotes (' and ") for string interpolation 
on our image src. This is an easy mistake to make as you cannot interpolate the strings when using regular quotes, 
you must use back ticks!
