1) String Interpolations
- quotes for string Interpolations:
Remember to use the back tick  ` and NOT regular single or double quotes (' and ") for string interpolation 
on our image src. This is an easy mistake to make as you cannot interpolate the strings when using regular quotes, 
you must use back ticks!

2) State vs Props
In this project, our Parent Component is App.js, and only here, we have state (something that changes bc of user interaction).
This state is then passed down to the CardList Component (like an attribute) - just like how we have HTML attributes, we sent down monsters and give it our state
As soon as we pass our state down to a component, this component receives it as a prop.

State usually lives in just ONE LOCATION or a SPECIFIC STATE only on one location and it trickles down as props

3) Asynchronous vs Synchronous
- Synchronous action: 
something that we can expect to happen almost immediately. It's something that pretty much happens and JavaScript knows the amount of time it'll take so javascript
will wait for that thing to finish before it continues.

- Asynchronous action:
Running the rest of the code afterwards an asynchronous action or event is something that actually takes
an indefinite amount of time that JavaScript does not know.
So what it does is it actually runs the rest of the code after and then when the asynchronous event
finishes it then runs that finished event.

4) HTML Synthetic Events - html onchange vs jsx onchange (they're different, and we use jsx)

5) ARRAY METHOD - filter()
Example:
const myArray = [ 1, 3, 5, 7, 9]
< undefined

myArray.filter( el => el > 4 )              // whatever is > 4 (TRUE), will be KEPT in the modified myArray
< (3) [5, 7, 9]                             // FALSE, delete

myArray.filter( el => true )                //we get back everything if we just return true 
< (5) [ 1, 3, 5, 7, 9]

myArray.filter( el => false )                
< []

myArray                                     //original
< (5) [ 1, 3, 5, 7, 9]

6) ARRAY METHOD - includes()
The other array methods that we've covered so far includes is essentially a method that takes a single argument 
and that argument will be any element that we want and what it does is it checks inside the
array to see if the element that we passed it exists in our array.
Example:
const myArray = [ 1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
< undefined

myArray.includs(3)
< true
myArray.includs(9)
< false

//The second argument that we could take in is the index, in which we want to start searching from
myArray.includs(2, 3)           //checking whether the value 2 exists, starting from index 3
< false
myArray.includs(2, 1)
< true

const newArray = [{id:1}, {id:2}, {id:3}]
< undefined
newArray.includes({id:2})
< false                             //false because of the way javascript references objects vs primitive types

const obj1 = { id:1 }
< undefined
const obj2 = { id:1 }
< undefined
obj1 === obj2
< false                             //because what js is comparing is, if the reference in memory is the same. It's not comparing whether or not this value of this object is equal to each other.
                                    //It's comparing if they're both pointing to the same place in memory this only works if we were to do
//but if we were to do this:
const obj3 = obj2                   //Now both obj3 & obj2 are pointing to the same object in memory
< undefined
obj3
< { id:1 }                            //now obj3 is pointing to { id:1 }

//Now if we change obj2 to sth else, obj3 will remain as { id:1 }
obj2.id = 17
< 17
obj2 
< { id:17 }
obj3
< { id:1 }

7) Primitive types (string, boolean, null, undefined, number, symbol)
These primitive types are all stored inside javascript's memory bank.
When we set a constant or var equal to a primitive type, e.g. the number 3 (var a = 3), 
what js is doing is its setting/creating a new variable that we want called a, and its pointing its value to the number 3 in its memory so its actually pointing to 3 in its memory

methods are properties that points to functions

8) 'this' keyword
this is a special keyword in js that references the context in which it's being invoked
- When we type this.state, we're trying to reference the state on our class component.
- When we're calling this.state, JavaScript is able to understand that we want the state object on our component because
'this' keyword is set to the context of our class component.

- However, in JS, when we write our own class methods (i.e. method() {...}, like componentDidMount(){}), we see that the 'this' keyword gets bound differently depending on how we write the class method.
- When we call super(), we're actually extending the functionality that exists on the component

- e.g. if we type handleChange(e) { this.setState... } outside render, there'll be an error and setState is undefined. We need to bind it in constructor
- dot bind is a method on any function that returns a new function where the context of 'this' is set to whatever we passed to it and 
the context of 'this' that we're setting in handleChange right here is the this keyword that is defined inside of our constructor which knows that it's our component
- BUT this.handleChange = this.handleChange.bind(this) is a v verbose way of writing, instead, we can simply use ES6 to bind.
    handleChange= (e) => {
        this.setState({ searchField: e.target.value })
    }
- the context of the arrow function is our app component, so it will automatically bind. Lexical scoping --> they bind this context to where it was defined in the first place.

9) How to update packages:
(a) Check what version of whatever packages that you want to upgrade and is currently running
(b) Go to your terminal - npm ls react react-dom react-scripts  
    [e.g. if we know that react and react-dom can be upgraded further, instead of directly modifying the value on terminal,
    we can go to package.json --> so that we make sure that, whenever we want to upgrade we can always use the latest version]
(c) Go to package.json, inside dependencies we have react and react-dom
    [if you created this using cra, you might see a ^ carrot sign infront of your version - this is a rule that tells whatever
    packge manager we're using (yarn or NPM), whenever we see npm upgrade, it will upgrade to the latest stable non breaking version
    however, without ^, whenever u run npm install it'll only run the exact version u have there.]

    [however, if we simply edit package.json and then run npm upgrade, we will see an Outdated lockfile --> type npm install]

    [what is this lock file?]
    
    [npm list react react-dom react-scripts]
    [npm update]                                                //different from npm install, install will skip versions if there's no major updates
    > updated versions... found 0 vulnerabilities               //what are vulnerabilities? major/minor security concerns -- has to do with either a dependency installed/ a dependency that your packages depend
    [npm audit fix]                                             //to fix vulnerabilities and this command will go thru and update the versions to a version of a package where it doesnt have the security concern anymore (different for yarn, not so ez - need to do it manually)
